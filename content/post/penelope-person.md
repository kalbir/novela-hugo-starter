# Penelope Person

## How did you get into product?

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar. No, really. The bar wanted to build an app for unusual cocktail recipes and I took the job of working what it should be like. 

## How do you prioritise?

I've always found prioritising a bit of a nonsense really. That's a bit of a joke but also a bit true. I find that things float to the top if you wait for them.
